pycclone
========

A plugin based documentation generator based off the [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/) and [Pycco](http://fitzgen.github.io/pycco/) projects.

### Why pycclone?

Docco and its relatives are quite wonderful; however, its monolithic nature makes extension and customization rather painful.
Pycclone aims to be easily extensible and styleable by implementing an extremely simple plugin architecture.
